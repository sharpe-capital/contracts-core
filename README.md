# Sharpe Capital Token
The Sharpe Capital token will be available on the Ethereum public blockchain, with the ticker symbol SHP. We will be launching our ICO soon, with more details on our website coming soon...

## Technical Details

SHP is an ERC20-compliant token, derived from the [MiniMe Token](https://github.com/Giveth/minime), that allows for token "cloning", which will be useful for many future use-cases.

## Minting Tokens

Once our ICO launches, contributors will be able to "mint" SHP tokens by sending Ethereum to a contributor address. Upon receipt of 1 ETH, the following amount of SHP will be generated:

- 2,000 SHP will be sent to the address of the user that sent the 1 ETH.
- 2,000 SHP will be sent to a multi-signature 'reserve address'. These tokens will be used to raise further capital in future.
- 1,000 SHP will be sent to a multi-signature 'founders & community address'. These tokens will vest according the the vesting schedule set out below, and will be used to reward those that contribute to the success of the Sharpe project.

## Vesting Schedule

TBC
